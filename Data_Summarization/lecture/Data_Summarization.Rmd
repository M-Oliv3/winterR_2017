## Data Summarization

* Basic statistical summarization
    * `mean(x)`: takes the mean of x
    * `sd(x)`: takes the standard deviation of x
    * `median(x)`: takes the median of x
    * `quantile(x)`: displays sample quantities of x. Default is min, IQR, max
    * `range(x)`: displays the range. Same as c(min(x), max(x))

## Some examples

We can use the `mtcars` and Charm City Circulator datasets to explore different ways of summarizing data.  The `head` command displays the first `6` (default) rows of an object:

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```


## Statistical summarization

Note - the `$` references/selects columns from a `data.frame`/`tibble`:

```{r}
mean(mtcars$hp)
quantile(mtcars$hp)
```

## Statistical summarization

```{r}
median(mtcars$wt)
quantile(mtcars$wt, probs = 0.6)
```

## Statistical summarization

`t.test` will be covered more in detail later, gives a mean and 95\% CI:

```{r}
t.test(mtcars$wt) 
```

## Statistical summarization

Note that many of these functions have additional inputs regarding missing data, typically requiring the `na.rm` argument ("remove NAs"). 

```{r}
x = c(1,5,7,NA,4,2, 8,10,45,42)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
quantile(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Data Summarization on matrices/data frames

* Basic statistical summarization
    * `rowMeans(x)`: takes the means of each row of x
    * `colMeans(x)`: takes the means of each column of x
    * `rowSums(x)`: takes the sum of each row of x
    * `colSums(x)`: takes the sum of each column of x
    * `summary(x)`: for data frames, displays the quantile information

## TB Incidence 

Please download the TB incidence data: 

http://www.aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/data/tb_incidence.xlsx

Here we will read in a `data.frame` of values from TB incidence:

```{r}
library(readxl)
tb <- read_excel("../../data/tb_incidence.xlsx")
head(tb)
```

## Indicator of Mortality

We can rename the first column to be the country measured using the `rename` function in `dplyr` (we have to use the \` things because there are spaces in the name):

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tb = rename(tb, 
            country = `TB incidence, all forms (per 100 000 population per year)`)
```



## Column and Row means

`colMeans` and `rowMeans` must work on all numeric data.  We will subset years before 2000:

```{r colMeans}
avgs = select(tb, starts_with("1"))
colMeans(avgs, na.rm = TRUE)
tb$before_2000_avg = rowMeans(avgs, na.rm = TRUE)
head(tb[, c("country", "before_2000_avg")])
```

## Summary

Using `summary` can give you rough snapshots of each column, but you would likely use `mean`, `min`, `max`, and `quantile` when necessary:

```{r summary1}
summary(tb)
```

## Apply statements

You can apply more general functions to the rows or columns of a matrix or data frame, beyond the mean and sum.

```
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)
```

> X : an array, including a matrix.
> 
> MARGIN : a vector giving the subscripts which the function will be applied over. E.g., for a matrix 1 indicates rows, 2 indicates columns, c(1, 2) indicates rows and columns. Where X has named dimnames, it can be a character vector selecting dimension names.
> 
> FUN	: the function to be applied: see 'Details'. 
> 
> ...	: optional arguments to FUN.

## Apply statements

```{r apply1}
apply(avgs,2,mean,na.rm=TRUE) # column means
apply(avgs,2,sd,na.rm=TRUE) # columns sds
apply(avgs,2,max,na.rm=TRUE) # column maxs
```

## Other Apply Statements

* `tapply()`: 'grouping' apply
* `lapply()`: 'list' apply [tomorrow]
* `sapply()`: 'simple' apply [tomorrow]
* Other less used ones...

## Youth Tobacco Survey

Please download the Youth Tobacco Survey data.  You can also read it in directly from the web:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
smoke = read_csv(
  "http://www.aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv")
```

## Subsetting to specific columns

Let's just take smoking status measures for all genders using `filter`, and the columns that represent the year, state using `select` (covered more in detail later):

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
sub_smoke = filter(smoke, 
                   MeasureDesc == "Smoking Status",
                   Gender == "Overall",
                   Response == "Current")
sub_smoke = select(sub_smoke, YEAR, LocationDesc, Data_Value)
head(sub_smoke, 4)
```


## `tapply()`

From the help file: "Apply a function to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty) group of values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors."

```
tapply(X, INDEX, FUN = NULL, ..., simplify = TRUE)
```

Simply put, you can apply function `FUN` to `X` within each categorical level of `INDEX`. It is very useful for assessing properties of continuous data by levels of categorical data.

## `tapply()`

For example, we can estimate the average current smoking statuses over all states for each year: 

```{r tapply1}
tapply(sub_smoke$Data_Value, sub_smoke$YEAR, max, na.rm = TRUE)
```
    
## Perform Operations By Groups: dplyr

`group_by` allows you group the data in a more intuitive way than `tapply`

We will use `group_by` to group the data by line, then use `summarize` (or `summarise`) to get the mean Average ridership:

```{r}
summarize(group_by(sub_smoke, YEAR), year_avg = mean(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE))
```    


## Using the `pipe` (comes with `dplyr`):

Pipe `sub_smoke` into `group_by`, then pipe that into `summarize`:

```{r}
smoke_avgs = sub_smoke %>% 
  group_by(YEAR) %>% 
  summarize(year_avg = mean(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE))
head(smoke_avgs)
```

## Data Summarization/Visualization

* Basic summarization plots
    * `plot(x,y)`: scatterplot of x and y
    * `boxplot(y~x)`: boxplot of y against levels of x
    * `hist(x)`: histogram of x
    * `density(x)`: kernel density plot of x
    
## Basic Plots

Plotting is an important component of exploratory data analysis. We will review some of the more useful and informative plots here. We will go over formatting and making plots look nicer in additional lectures.

## Scatterplot

```{r scatter1}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
```

## Histograms

```{r hist1}
hist(tb$before_2000_avg)
```

## Plot with a line

`type = "l"` means a line

```{r hist_date}
plot(smoke_avgs$YEAR, smoke_avgs$year_avg, type = "l")
```

## Density

Over all years and states, this is the density of smoking status incidence:

```{r dens1,fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
plot(density(sub_smoke$Data_Value))
```

## Boxplots

```{r box1}
boxplot(sub_smoke$Data_Value ~ sub_smoke$LocationDesc)
```

## Boxplots


```{r box2}
boxplot(Data_Value ~ LocationDesc, data = sub_smoke)
```

## Data Summarization for data.frames

* Basic summarization plots
    * `matplot(x,y)`: scatterplot of two matrices, x and y
    * `pairs(x,y)`: plots pairwise scatter plots of matrices x and y, column by column

## Matrix plot

```{r matplot1}
pairs(avgs)
```


## Conclusion

- Base R has apply statements that perform things repeatedly.
- `dplyr` has a lot of more intuitive syntax.
    - `group_by` is very powerful, especilly with `summarise/summarize`
- Base R has good things for quickly summarizing rows or colummns of all numeric data.
    - The `matrixStats` package extends this to `colMedians`, `colMaxs`, etc.
