library(readr)
library(dplyr)

## 1. read in the roads and crashes CSVs
# crashes: http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Manipulating_Data_in_R/lab/crashes.csv
# roads: http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Manipulating_Data_in_R/lab/roads.csv
crash = read_csv("http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Manipulating_Data_in_R/lab/crashes.csv")
road = read_csv("http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Manipulating_Data_in_R/lab/roads.csv")

## 2. How many observations are in each dataset?
dim(crash)
dim(road)

## 3. Which and how many years were data collected?
unique(crash$Year)
length(unique(crash$Year))

## 4. Join data to retain only complete data, 
##	e.g. those observations with road lengths and districts
dat = right_join(crash, road)

## 5. Which district had the largest volume of traffic, 
##		per mile/unit length over the provided years?
dat$VolPerMile = dat$Volume/dat$Length
dat = dat %>% mutate(VolPerMile = Volume/Length)
dat %>% group_by(District) %>% 
	summarize(Total = sum(VolPerMile,na.rm=TRUE))
# all in one shot
dat %>% mutate(VolPerMile = Volume/Length) %>% 
	group_by(District) %>% 
	summarize(Total = sum(VolPerMile,na.rm=TRUE))

## 6. Which district had the largest number of crashes, 
##		accounting for road length and volume 
## 		over the provided years?

dat %>% mutate(CrashAdj = N_Crashes/(Volume/1000)/Length) %>% 
	group_by(District) %>% 
	summarize(Total = sum(CrashAdj,na.rm=TRUE))
## per thousand cars and mile
